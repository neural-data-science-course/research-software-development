# Intermediate research software development skills
Lesson material: https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/python-intermediate-development

This is an optional model that will teach you about: virtual environments, Integrated Software Development Environments (IDEs), Python code style conventions, 
automatically testing software, software architecture and design, 
writing reusable software, software management. 

These skills are vital if you want to develop reusable and sustainable neural data science software,
but they are not required for taking the [Neural Data Science Course](https://neural-data-science-course.github.io/).

You can cherry-pick from the lesson material as you like.
