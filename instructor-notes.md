# Instructor notes
## 01. Introduction to git
Teach what you think is most useful. See how far you get, usually we get to episode 7 in one morning.
To give participants a good understanding of the git basics, we suggest to:
* Ignore the temptation to answer advanced questions. (You can of course do this individually during exercises).
* Only focus on the bare essentials for setting up git ([episode 2](https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/02-setup/index.html))
* Focus on the main concept of ignoring files with a `.gitignore` file, instead of fully learning the syntax. ([episode 6](https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/06-ignore/index.html))
* Take a dedicated moment right before [episode 7](https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/07-github/index.html) to check successful completion of particpants' SSH setup and help out people who did not succeed yet. You will need 15-30 minutes for this.)

## 02. Collaborative software development with git and GitHub
You can show how to create a branch and pull request first, then let students collaborate with each other on a github project.
See for example [this exercise](https://github.com/esciencecenter-digital-skills/good-practices-in-research-software-development/blob/main/episodes/03-collaborative-version-control.md#exercise-working-as-a-project-collaborator-in-groups)
